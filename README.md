# MySidebar

A sidebar is an element used in web design to arrange or list important information in a column on the left, right or both sides of the screen. In React, these sidebars are very easy to create.

A sidebar can serve several purposes, such as displaying business-relevant information to the user, displaying a subscription box and increasing the number of subscribers to the website, displaying the webmaster's or blogger's contact details, or displaying advertising. However, there are also some drawbacks of using a sidebar, such as distracting the user from reading the main article, or losing relevance on mobile devices due to responsive web design.

The sidebar code example I'm giving you is a React code that creates a sidebar with a toggle button and an animation effect when opening and closing. This code can be used to integrate it into your project if you want to have a sidebar that adapts to different screen sizes and that can be hidden or shown according to the user's preference.

## Run
